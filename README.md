# Premise:
Wanted to play around with the new browser sound capabilities while also building a
web app that could pass as a legitimate multi touch mobile application on a tablet for
live performance.

# Tech Features:
- ES6 JS/CSS/HTML front end with as much browser compatibility as I could build in
- Multi-touch support on mobile devices
- Makes use of much of the new at the time browser sound functionality
- Interaction rules change based on input from mouse or input from touch
- Focus on application performance
- Very modular and event driven
